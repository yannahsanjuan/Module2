# Yannah San Juan | Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project is to create a website that showcases my information, skills, and qualifications. I built this project to give potential clients and companies an overview of myself as a way for them to consider me for any future projects. This website will also serve as a non-stop project as I plan on updating it every project I work on. It solves a missing connection between me and a potential employer. I learned that by having your own portfolio website, it makes it easier to connect with people and give an overview of yourself as a person and as a Software Developer.
